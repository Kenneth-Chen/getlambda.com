                  I am the CTO of a Biotech Startup - Full Genomes Corporation - and sought Lambda’'s help in launching our website and for advice on all things technology. Andrew has been a highly efficient worker, who has an impressive knowledge of Open Source tools and technologies and has the creativity to formulate novel solutions and the technical chops to create and deploy them. He has never failed to deliver superlative results, and I would not hesitate to recommend him to anyone seeking a top class solution architect, developer or systems integrator.
