                  As the CTO of an NYC-based web startup, I originally sought out Lambda for expertise developing and scaling web applications. I was particularly impressed by Andrew's knowledge of both backend and frontend technologies, as well as his real experience scaling software  at Adaptly. Andrew's know-how has proven to be extremely helpful for us  and we feel lucky to be working with him. I gladly recommend Lambda to anyone looking for a web development partner!
