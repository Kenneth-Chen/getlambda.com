                I am the CTO of a Biotech Startup - Full Genomes Corporation - and sought Lambdaâ€™'s help in launching our website and for advice on all things technology. Andrew has been a highly efficient worker, who has an impressive knowledge of Open Source tools and technologies and has the creativity to formulate novel solutions and the technical chops to create and deploy them. He has never failed to deliver superlative results, and I would not hesitate to recommend him to anyone seeking a top class solution architect, developer or systems integrator.

                As the CTO of an NYC-based web startup, I originally sought out Lambda for expertise developing and scaling web applications. I was particularly impressed by Andrew's knowledge of both backend and frontend technologies, as well as his real experience scaling software  at Adaptly. Andrew's know-how has proven to be extremely helpful for us  and we feel lucky to be working with him. I gladly recommend Lambda to anyone looking for a web development partner!
