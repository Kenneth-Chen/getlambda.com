        Our projects are built-in collaboration between our in-house team of NYC developers (we call them partners) and an extended network of independent talent (we call them associates). We’re always looking to work with skilled professionals and would love to talk with you if you're considering taking a new job or are just looking for your next gig.

            Your team is ready
          %p.smallFontBy08
            Joining Lambda means you’ll never need to turn down clients again or risk over-promising. If a project is too big for one person, you can always bring in a Lambda teammate to help.

            Freelance lifestyle
          %p.smallFontBy08 
            Partners pick the projects we work on. If you want the flexibility of running your own freelance business, you’ll find it here. We’ll take care of the boring stuff, like preparing contracts and running payroll.

          %p.smallFontBy08                
            Most of our partners have significant technology experience, but are new to marketing, finding leads, and closing sales. We’ll teach you everything we know about the business side and hope to learn from you as well.

          Lambda has been tremendously valuable in sourcing high caliber developers of equal skill and integrity.  They are efficient, flexible, and reliable having procured specialists for projects on short notice while also tirelessly working to find the right individuals to fill our longer-term roles. They are truly best-in-class, and I highly recommend their services.

            Our in-house team is small and focused, so we rely on a trusted network of associates. If you love your craft, but don’t want to get bogged down in business details like finding clients, we’d love to talk with you.

          %p.smallFontBy08
            Unlike traditional agencies, we’ll never assign you to a project you don’t want. Like a freelancer, you choose what you'd like to work on, and when you want to work.

          %p.smallFontBy08
            We work primarily with early-stage startups. You won't get stuck doing maintenance work or wrestling with huge legacy applications. You'll only work on projects that we'd want to work on ourselves.

            Leads
          %p.smallFontBy08
            We go out to networking events every day to generate leads. We avoid looking at online job boards because we only want to work with the most qualified clients.
