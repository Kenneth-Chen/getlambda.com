              %p.smallFontBy08
                Joining Lambda means you’ll never need to turn down clients again or risk over-promising. If a project is too big for one person, you can always bring in a Lambda teammate to help.

              %p.smallFontBy08
                We go out to networking events every day to generate leads. We avoid looking at online job boards because we only want to work with the most qualified clients.

                Partners pick the projects we work on. If you want the flexibility of running your own freelance business, you’ll find it here. But we’ll take care of the boring stuff, like preparing contracts and running payroll.

                Unlike traditional agencies, we’ll never assign you to a project you don’t want. Like a freelancer, you choose what you'd like to work on, and when you want to work.

                We work primarily with early-stage startups. You won't get stuck doing maintenance work or wrestling with huge legacy applications. You'll only work on projects that we'd want to work on ourselves.
