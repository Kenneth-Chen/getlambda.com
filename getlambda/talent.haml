              %strong Partners
            are experienced entrepreneurs who have often made successful exits from their own companies. They know all about the common pitfalls and challenges of building a startup from the ground up. They'll work with you during the early stages of a project to help you figure out what to build and in what order, given your timeframe and budget.
          %p
            = succeed "," do
              %strong Associates
            tend to be freelancers with 3-5+ years of development or design experience. They're highly motivated, are experts in agile methodoglies, and are up-to-date on software development best practices. They're very, very good at what they do.

            Unlike traditional devshops, we don't just implement a spec. We help you figure out

              Make more money -- we negotiate on your behalf to get you the highest rate possible. In almost every case, our consultants have earned a higher rate than they previously asked for on their own.
            %li
              We find clients – 'Nuff said
            %li
              Serious clients only – Wanna hear about a disruptive social network for cats that "just needs a coder"? Neither do we.
            %li
              Safe – Payments are held in escrow and released as the work is completed
            %li
              Easy – We take care of the paperwork and the legalese.

      %h3 What does it mean to become a Lambda partner?
      .row
        .span8.offset2
          %ul
            %li
              You'd get complete access to our database of developers for any project you'd like to take on. And they're all people who have been evaluated by us personally.
            %li
              You'd get access to as many leads as you can handle from us (we go out to networking events every day to generate leads).
            %li
              If you close a sale for us, you'd get the credit, regardless of whether you decide to work on the project yourself, or assign it to someone else.
            %li 
              You can send us any leads that you come across, and get paid for those as well, if we end up closing on them.
            %li
              You'd be able to leverage the Lambda brand when pitching yourself to potential clients. It doesn't matter if you haven't gotten around to building your portfolio yet, because you can simply show them ours.
            %li
              You'd agree not to work on freelance projects outside of Lambda. Working on your own side projects, or on your own startup is completely fine -- in fact, most of our people have some sort of side project.

      .row
        .span8.offset2
          %ul
            %li
              Have you ever had trouble generating leads? Get an infinite stream of leads from us -- as many as you can handle. We have a team of people who go out to networking events every day to generate qualified leads. We avoid looking on online job boards, because we only want to work with the most qualified clients.
            %li
              Have you ever said "no" to a client, because you didn't have the availability, or because you don't have the right skillset? As a Lambda partner, you'd get complete access to our pool of developers. Work with the developer yourself, or simply make the introduction, get your cut, and move on.
            %li
              Have a lot of development experience but are new to freelancing and want to start your own freelancing business? We can help you get there. You'll be involved in every aspect of the sales cycle and we'll teach you everything we know -- only if you want to, of course.
