          <p>Your incredible talent will get you in the door.  But even if you do the most amazing job, if you come with drama and complications you won’t be asked back.  Here are a few pointers to help make sure you get called in every time.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2>Exceed expectations</h2>

<p>If the client hired you, it’s likely they are working over capacity. That means they have less time to do more work, including overseeing your project.  So be professional at all aspects of the job.  Get to meetings on time.  Meet deadlines. And try to accommodate their schedule as best you can.</p>

<h2>Stick to the Task at Hand</h2>

<p>You may have been recommended for your creative thinking, but in the end they hired you to do the job they have already delineated.  If you have a great new idea, by all means, suggest it, but make sure you have the brief covered.  The client will appreciate your fresh perspective only if they feel you have their main assignment covered.</p>

<h2>Listen Before You Talk</h2>

<p>This sounds like a no brainer, but a lot of freelancers don’t get rehired because they get the reputation of being difficult. So serve up your great solution, but only after you’ve carefully listened to the client feedback.  If the client has to spend a lot of time struggling to make you understand their point, they won’t remember you as a thought leader, they’ll remember you as a pain.</p>

<h2>Be Discreet</h2>

<p>Your current client is paying your for your skills and expertise.  And while, your last job may inform your current work, remember to be appropriate when you share ideas that came for a previous client’s project. You don’t want anyone to think you will be giving away their strategic thinking, capabilities, or proprietary work.</p>

<h2>Check In Along the Project</h2>

<p>Until a client trusts you know what you’re doing you may want to set up mini check in. That way you can show them you are on track, and it also gives you both a good idea if the hours you originally agreed on are accurate.</p>

<h2>Don’t Pad Your Hours</h2>

<p>Be sensitive to the client’s scope. But don’t sell yourself short. If you feel like you need more time than you originally estimated, let the client know early on, so they can make the decision if they can afford (or want) to change their budget.</p>

<h2>Be On Their Radar</h2>

<p>Once you’ve finished up, check in and let your client know that you are available again. Reinforce your latest gigs so that they remember that you are in high demand. If they don’t respond to one email, follow up&mdash;emails do get lost&mdash;but don’t bombard them. This where social media can help.  If you are connected with them on LinkedIn or follow them on Twitter, you’ll have a more consistent presence organically and they’ll be able to see what you’re up to.</p>

<h2>Be The Solution</h2>

<p>Finally, be great at what they asked you to do. Come in with the skills and the knowledge to get the job done. Do it on time, within budget, and better than they expected.  Your job is to make your client look good. If you do that, they’ll remember it and give you another call the next time they need help.</p>

<p>What do you think? How do you make your clients love you (and call again)?</p>
